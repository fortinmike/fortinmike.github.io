features:
  - title: Support for Multiple Music Players
    details: Sleepytime 2 introduces support for players other than iTunes. Sleepytime can now control iTunes, Spotify, Rdio, Ecoute and Pulsar.
  - title: Sleep Timer
    details: Sleepytime can stop your music after the duration you choose. Have the music fade out over time so it doesn't stop abruptly and wake you up.
  - title: Alarm Clock
    details: Wake up to your music the next morning! Sleepytime guides you through a few simple steps to make sure the volume is just right when you go to sleep and when you wake up. The app can fade in the volume so that you wake up smoothly and refreshed.
  - title: Computer Actions and Scripts
    details: Have your computer shut down, restart, go to sleep or have Sleepytime log you out of your user account when the music stops playing. Or have Sleepytime run any script or Automator workflow on Mountain Lion or later.
  - title: Local Weather
    details: When you finally get up in the morning to stop the alarm, Sleepytime will show the local weather in a cool animated display. The app can also automatically determine your location (if you allow it to do so) and retrieve the local weather automatically.
  - title: Text-to-Speech
    details: Sleepytime 2 introduces text-to-speech support using any of Mac OS X's built-in voices, including the high quality voices introduced in Mac OS X Lion. Have Sleepytime tell you the time and/or a word or sentence of your choosing when you snooze the alarm.
  - title: Player Controls
    details: New in Sleepytime 2 is a player control bar. This bar, located just below the animated display, enables you to quickly skip tunes, toggle repeat and shuffle, change the volume and more for the active player without requiring you to bring up the player in question.
  - title: Works With Your Apple Remote
    details: Snooze the alarm by pausing iTunes with your Apple Remote or by any other means you're used to. No need to unlock your computer! Note though that Apple Remote snooze support is limited for players other than iTunes.
  - title: Fullscreen
    details: Go to sleep watching a nice and calm animated night sky, or any of the nice built-in fullscreen compositions. The song, artist and remaining time are also displayed in fullscreen mode.
  - title: User-Created Fullscreen Compositions
    details: Sleepytime 2 enables you to create and use your own compositions in fullscreen mode.
  - title: Backup Alarm
    details: Make sure you always wake up on time even if your favorite player doesn't start playing as expected. A life saver if, for example, you're using Rdio and your Internet connection is down when the time comes to wake up.
