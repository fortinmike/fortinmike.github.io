						<ul class="features">
							<li>Retina graphics & small UI refinements.</li>
							<li>Added support for the Decibel music player by Sbooth.</li>
							<li>Replaced the "computer actions" feature with a brand new scripts runner on Mountain Lion and later. You can download a scripts pack from within the app to get the app to put your Mac to sleep and more when the music stops playing.</li>
							<li>More robust animations rendering, meaning even more stability.</li>
							<li>Replaced local help with online help for more reliability and always up-to-date help pages.</li>
							<li>Added opt-in anonymous usage statistics.</li>
							<li>Fixed: The app was displaying a wrong subtitle when a player wasn't running.</li>
							<li>Fixed: computer actions (sleep, restart, shutdown, logout) were not working on Mountain Lion due to a change in the Mac OS X sandbox environment.</li> 
							<li>Fixed: The active music player was not detected when waking the computer from sleep.</li>
							<li>Fixed: The preview alarm music button sometimes did not work after launching the app.</li>
							<li>Other small tweaks and bug fixes.</li>
