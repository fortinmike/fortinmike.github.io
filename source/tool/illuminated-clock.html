features:
  - title: Looks Nice
    details: Yes, it looks nice. At least I think so!
  - title: Displays The Time
    details: Another thing the screen saver is good at is displaying the time. Which is a good thing for a clock screen saver to be able to do.
  - title: Day / Night Cycle
    details: The ambient lighting changes depending on the hour of the day so at night the clock face is barely visible and the dials stand out with a nice green glow. Check out the screenshots!
