    details: "Pro Picker is a native macOS color picker plugin, which means you can use it in almost all apps that use the system picker: Pixelmator, TextEdit, ColorChooser and more."
  - title: "Hue, Saturation and Brightness"
    details: "Display fixed hue, saturation or brightness spectrums at the push of a button."
  - title: "Dynamic Color Sliders"
    details: "Color sliders with live previews show you at a glance the effect they would have on the current color."
  - title: "Precise Color Spectrum"

  - title: "Live Preview"
    details: "Click or drag on the spectrum to choose a color. The sliders and fields update in real-time to reflect the current color values. Change a value and the spectrum updates accordingly."
