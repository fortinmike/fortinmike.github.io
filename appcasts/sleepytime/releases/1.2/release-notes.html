					Hi there! Unfortunately Sleepytime 1 has reached the end of its life, but from its ashes rose Sleepytime 2!
				</p>
				<p>
					Sleepytime 2 sells for 4.99$ on the Mac App Store. As a way to say thanks, <b>all those of you who already donated will receive a free Sleepytime 2 licence</b>! Simply send me an e-mail at <a href="mailto:fortinmike@irradiated.net">fortinmike@irradiated.net</a> using the same e-mail account that you used to make your donation (your PayPal address) and I'll contact you shortly with a promo code to download the app for free on the Mac App Store. Note that this promotion does not apply to those who donate <i>after</i> the release of Sleepytime 2.0 (because I won't have enough promo codes to give away).
				</p>
				<p>
					Sleepytime 2 offers support for music players other than iTunes, text-to-speech, local weather, a player control bar and multiple custom fullscreen compositions along with the ability to create your own, use them in Sleepytime and share them with other users on the <a href="http://www.irradiated.net/?page=sleepytime#gallery" target="_blank">Sleepytime Compositions Gallery</a>, and more. Take a look at all of Sleepytime 2's main features <a href="http://www.irradiated.net/?page=sleepytime" target="_blank">here</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					This will be the last update for Sleepytime 1, unless a major bug needs fixing. Sleepytime 1 will remain available for free on Irradiated.net but future support may be limited.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thanks so much for being a Sleepytime user! I hope you like version 2 as much as I do! :)
